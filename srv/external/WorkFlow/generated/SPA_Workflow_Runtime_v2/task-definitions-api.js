     * The workflow definition ID is version independent. That means, this API assumes that task definitions are semantically the same if they span several
     * workflow versions and therefore have the same identifier. The latest workflow definition version is expected to contain the leading property values of
     * the task definition.
     *
     * At the moment, filtering is limited to the $skip and $top parameters for paging through the available task definitions.
     *
     * The returned task definitions are sorted in descending order of their creation time.
     *
     * Roles permitted to execute this operation:
     *   - Global roles: ProcessAutomationAdmin
     * @param queryParameters - Object containing the following keys: $skip, $top, $inlinecount, $expand.
     * @returns The request builder, use the `execute()` method to trigger the request.
